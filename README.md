Start text with **>** to make a command. The commands include the following:

*These are the commands for calculating.*

- **add**: For addition
- **subt**: For subtraction

- **fdiv**: For floor division

**Note that the calculating commands take two numbers as parameter and also requires special formatting to work with.

_For example: >command a, b_**

The bot is not uploaded in any cloud server, so it remains offline all the time.
